                <p>Adelina is an application which is meant to connect the elderly
                with volunteering oppurtunities. The project was the result of our task
                to create a product which contributes to active aging and improves       
                the quality of life for our seniors.

            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>In order to develop a product that actually 
                speaks to the wants and habits of elderly people, 
                we wanted to gain real insight into their lives. 
                In order to do that we conducted a focus group interview, 
                discussing their overall use of technology, what they 
                do in their free time and their attitudes towards 
                helping and being helped. It is easy to make 
                the assumption that all elderly only need assistance, 
                but we learned that it is hard to strike a balance 
                between offering them real benefits and infantilizing 
                the elderly. </p>

        <div class="textcenter"> 
            <p>Our interviews resulted in personas that strongly shaped our product concept. 
            Instead of offering an app that assists the elderly physically only, 
            we decided to develop a social platform which enables them to help NGOs 
            in social and light work settings. This will provide purpose and community 
            - very important factors in active aging. </p>

            <h4>Ideation and Prototyping</h4>
            <p>To develop the requirements of our product we wrote user stories and did extensive sketching and paper prototyping. 
                One of the biggest challenges while thinking about the specific functionalities of the platform were the struggles 
                of the elderly to use phones and apps. At the end we settled for a web interface for the NGOs and to use texting 
                to communicate with the elderly most effectively. 
                After that we digitalized and substantialized our work as wireframes in Adobe XD.  </p>

            <p>The screens you see are meant for the people 
            and NGOs who host the non-profit events.</p>
            <p>Our goal was to create a design 
            which conveys vigor and competence.</p>
            <p>The calm green tones and the simple layout
            help you easily have an overview over all your options
            without being overwhelmed by the inforation.
